# PetersMathNotes
This is a long term project to create a curriculum of areas of mathematics that are not commonly taught nowadays.  

It will trace the classical Quadrivium of Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy, with notation updated to the modern version.

Geometry is the first goal, following Euclid's Elements and Hung Hsi Wu's Algebra and Geometry to start. 

Geometry becomes Astronomy through extending planar trigonometry to spherical trigonometry.

Classical Arithmetic and Music will follow afterwards.
